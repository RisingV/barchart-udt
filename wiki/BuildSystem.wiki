#summary Build System

<wiki:toc />

= Introduction =

This project has 3 build systems:
  * Development CDT
  * Development NAR
  * Production NAR


= Development CDT =

used for interactive development of both java and c++ code inside eclipse; allows to handle only single target platform at a time;

you must have eclipse cdt installed in your eclipse before you will be able to see cdt project configuration settings; you must also activate eclipse cdt perspective;

there are 6 cdt configs in this project (for each arch and os):
  * cdt_i386-Linux-gpp
  * cdt_amd64-Linux-gpp
  * cdt_i386-MacOSX-gpp
  * cdt_x86_64-MacOSX-gpp
  * cdt_x86-Windows-gpp
  * cdt_amd64-Windows-gpp

you must select active build configuratin that matches your plaform arch and current java bitness;

you must have 2 named java jre defined in your eclipse: "java32" and "java64"

you must map one of these java jre to the "java se 1.6" in your eclipse;

you must have /usr/bin/bash or c:/cygwin/bin/bash available;

every time you update/save your java / c++ code in eclipse the following will happen:
  * java will get compiled and placed in target/classes
  * c++ will get compiled and placed in cdt-{arch}-{os}-gpp folder as well as into target/test-classes
  * console will show c++ build errors, if any;

double-click on the highlighted c++ console error will bring you back to the c++ source at the location of the error;


= Development NAR =

used for verification that maven-nar-plugin settings match to cdt settings; and that both cdt and nar produce identical libraries/artifacts;

there are numerous "maven launch configurations" provided for various maven-related tasks; study them and create your own;

for example:
  * "barchart-udt4_nar_macosx-32.m2e" will produce "development nar" libraries;
  * "barchart-udt4_test-macosx-32.m2e" will run all unit tests;

you must run appropriate version of m2e plugin in your eclipse;

you must have appropriate version on maven installed in
/opt/apache-maven-3.0.2

alternatively, you do not have to have eclipse to run these builds; you can run these maven builds from command line;

= Production NAR =

used for multi-platform hudson build with maven-nar-plugin 

the process involves brining up all target platforms, building libraries, running unit tests, integration tests and uploading jars and nars to the snapshot repo;
